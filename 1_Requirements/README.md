### Introduction

Calculator Application(Console application without any graphics) is a project that allow users to calculate basic operations in mathematics( addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial, modulus, power). However, the input has to be in the form "number1 number2 number3...soo on" as in advance the user will be asked to choose what operation he/she want to perform (i.e, addition,subtraction,power,etc) on the numbers. The input values can be from any integer to even a number with decimals.

### Features

1. The System is user friendly
2. The System is efficient and fast in response
3. The System can be customized according to needs

### Defining our System

Our System is an actual implementation of how a calculator works. We demonstrated its internal working, along with all necessary equipments that a general purpose user might find handy. This calculator may well fit into any other subsystems and can be useful in such circumstances. It allow users to calculate basic operations in mathematics( addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial, modulus, power). However, the input has to be in the form "number1 number2 number3...soo on" as in advance the user will be asked to choose what operation he/she want to perform (i.e, addition,subtraction,power,etc) on the numbers. The input values can be from any integer to even a number with decimals.

| division()             | used for dividing two or more numbers                   |
| factorial()            | used for finding factor of a number                     |
| modulus()              | used for finding modulus of a number                    |
| power()                | used for finding power(i.e,square,cube,etc) of a number |
| calculator_operations()| contains the menu for the user                          |


### System Requirements

1. Operating System : Windows(xp,7,8,10) , Linux(Ubuntu)
2. Language         : C Language
3. Processor        : Pentium IV or more
4. RAM              : 512 MB or more
5. Hard Disk        : 5 GB or more

### SWOT Analysis

1. Strength         : Simple Interface, Useful through Calculus, Programmable, Easy Memory Management, Screen is Interactive.

2. Weakness         : Sometimes Need an experienced user to operate, Limited operations for wide variety of applications in modern era.

3. Oppurtunities    : Automates the impact of computation and technology, Progresses the problem solving insights, Develops a ability to describe strategy retrospectively.

4. Threats          : Threats like Virus attack, code vulnerabilty, or cross platform.

### 4W And 1H

#### WHO
The project can be used almost by all. All the financial related employees and students can use the program to find out the answer they need. At the end, user satisfaction is the goal of the project.

#### WHAT
Calculations related to basic math and finance can be calculated quickly. All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

#### WHEN
The project can be used at the time of solving the calculations and get the results for basic and finance related problems. The result will be obtained quickly.

#### WHERE
In all the domains it can be used. As the project is portable and user-friendly, it can be easily implemented on the mobile systems and finance companies. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.

#### HOW
System design is a solution for “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.


### Detail Requirement
